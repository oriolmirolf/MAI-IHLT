    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we implement approaches to detect paraphrases using sentence similarity metrics by exploring:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lexical features alone**\n",
    "- **Syntactic features alone**\n",
    "- **Combination of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **XGBoost** as our machine learning model and cite properly where each technique is derived from, based on the curated compilation from SemEval 2012 papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding semantic similarity between sentences is essential for various NLP tasks, such as machine translation, summarization, and question answering. The SemEval 2012 Task 6 provided a benchmark for evaluating semantic textual similarity methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on insights from SemEval 2012 Task 6 papers ([2], [4], [8]), we implement the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lexical Features**  \n",
    "  Derived from methods used in SemEval 2012 papers [2], [4], [8].\n",
    "  - Jaccard similarity\n",
    "  - Normalized edit distance\n",
    "  - Cosine similarity using TF-IDF vectors\n",
    "  - Word n-gram overlap\n",
    "  - Character n-gram overlap\n",
    "  - Token overlap ratio\n",
    "  - Longest common subsequence\n",
    "  - String matching metrics\n",
    "  - Word order similarity\n",
    "  - Normalized difference in sentence lengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntactic Features**  \n",
    "  Derived from methods in SemEval 2012 papers [2], [3].\n",
    "  - POS tag overlap ratio\n",
    "  - POS tag sequence similarity\n",
    "  - Dependency relation overlap\n",
    "  - Grammatical relations overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Features**  \n",
    "  Derived from methods in SemEval 2012 papers [2], [8].\n",
    "  - WordNet-based similarity metrics\n",
    "  - Named entity overlap\n",
    "  - Semantic word overlap using synonyms\n",
